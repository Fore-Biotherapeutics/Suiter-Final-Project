# Suiter - Final Project

An app for selecting a suit.

## Introduction

 * Project goal: Our goal is to create an app that helps users choose a suit and see how it looks before buying it.

 * The Suiter application will allow the user to design a suit for an event by choosing a color for each item (jacket, shirt, tie..) and seeing how it all looks together.
