# Suiter - Final Project

An app for selecting a suit and adapting it to the user.


## Introduction

 * Project goal: Our goal is to create an app that helps users choose a suit and see how it looks on them before buying it.

 * The Suiter application will allow the user to choose a suit for himself and see how it will look on him. The user will provide a front view photograph of himself and 
   choose colors for the suit, and the application will draw the suit on top of him accordingly.
