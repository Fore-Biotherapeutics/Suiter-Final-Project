#### Question No. 1: What is the purpose of the page and what are the key metrics you assume we are monitoring and optimizing for?
The purpose of this page is to provide readers of the site "FX EMPIRE", with insight and deep understanding of the Forex and CFDs broker: "XTB", thorough and unbiased reviews, detailed by researching, analyzing and discussing aspects of the product and service, in order to help the investor understand whether this is the right broker for his needs.
The key metrics that we follow in this reviewed article and take care to optimize them, are the section overview:
- Investor Protection & Regulations
- Tradable Products
- Account Opening
- Deposit & Withdrawals options
- Web & Desktop Trading Platforms
- Mobile Trading Platforms
- Trading Features
- Commissions & Spreads
- Bonus & Promotions
- Customer Support
- Research
- Trader Education
- Trading Experience
- FAQ

#### Question No. 2: What would you do in order to improve these metrics?
The improvements I would make to improve the metrics are (change / improvement per metric):
- **Tradable Products:** Despite the availability of major currencies, such as: EUR, USD, GBP, it is recommended to expand types of Account Base Currency.
- **Account Opening:** 

---- Although XTB does very well in providing access to commerce to most people around the world, with more than 140,000 customers and growing, there are still some locations where they are not available. These include Canada and the United States as well as Japan, Brazil, Israel, Iran, Malaysia and Myanmar.

---- Only CySEC and FCA are provided as top regulators. These are two of the best, but some traders may want to see more leading regulators, so it's recommended to add more.

---- Reducing/reducing the fee collection for cryptocurrencies (Pro) and CFD transactions (Standard and Pro), since this collection is not to the customer's advantage.

- **Deposit & Withdrawals options:** 

---- Expand the withdrawal options, because according to this article, you can only withdraw by bank.

---- Reducing/reducing deposit fees for e-wallets, such as PayPal and Skrill.

---- Reduction of the commission (30%) on withdrawals lower than the required threshold (for example: $ 100), because this commission is too expensive and especially for casual traders.
