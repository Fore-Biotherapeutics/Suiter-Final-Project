## Questions:

#### Q1. What is the purpose of the page and what are the key metrics you assume we are monitoring and optimizing for?

The purpose of this page is to provide readers of the site "FX EMPIRE", with insight and deep understanding of the Forex and CFD broker: "XTB", thorough and unbiased reviews, detailed by researching, analyzing and discussing aspects of the product and service, in order to help the investor understand whether this is the right broker for his needs.
The key metrics that we follow in this reviewed article and take care to optimize them, are the section overview:
- Investor Protection & Regulations
- Tradable Products
- Account Opening
- Deposit & Withdrawals options
- Web & Desktop Trading Platforms
- Mobile Trading Platforms
- Trading Features
- Commissions & Spreads
- Bonus & Promotions
- Customer Support
- Research
- Trader Education
- Trading Experience
- FAQ


#### Q2. What would you do in order to improve these metrics?

The improvements I would make to improve the metrics are (change / improvement per metric):
- **Tradable Products:** Despite the availability of major currencies, such as: EUR, USD, GBP, it is recommended to expand types of Account Base Currency.
- **Account Opening:** 
  * Although XTB does very well in providing access to trading to most people around the world, with more than 140,000 customers and growing, there are still some locations where they are not available. These include Canada and the United States as well as Japan, Brazil, Israel, Iran, Malaysia and Myanmar.
  * Only CySEC and FCA are provided as top regulators. These are two of the best, but some traders may want to see more leading regulators, so it's recommended to add more.
  * Reducing/reducing the fee collection for cryptocurrencies (Pro) and CFD transactions (Standard and Pro), since this collection is not to the customer's advantage.
- **Deposit & Withdrawals options:** 
  * Expand the withdrawal options, because according to this article, you can only withdraw by bank.
  * Reducing/reducing deposit fees for e-wallets, such as PayPal and Skrill.
  * Reduction of the commission (30%) on withdrawals lower than the required threshold (for example: $ 100), because this commission is too expensive and especially for casual traders.
- **Trading Features:**
  * Comparing / raising XTB leverage to professional traders, as it is lower than most other large brokers.
  * Expanding trading platforms because there are only 2 trading platforms available.
  * Adaptation to integrated features of Social Trading or Copy Trading, from the broker side.
- **Commissions & Spreads:** Balance in spreads, because IFSC traders with XTB generally have higher spreads in place though there are more account types to choose from.
- **Bonus & Promotions:** Because account holders with European regulators and some other global regulators are not offered any bonus or promotions due to regulatory restrictions, these restrictions should be considered and "balanced" or "balanced" by a temporary/initial discount on the amount of a certain fee, such as a discount on the Pro bill in collection Commission on one of the above tools: Forex, Commodities, Indices, or cryptocurrencies. Likewise, the customer who is not from Belize, will not feel deprived and will receive a certain promotions/bonus when registering.
- **Research:** Adding depth and detail in certain areas that some traders would like to see, in the research-related part.
